### 1D Monoatomic Harmonic Crystals

( extract from chapter 2 of [Acoustic Metamaterials and Phononic Crystals | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-31232-8))

The dispersion relation for the propagating waves in 1D monoatomic harmonic crystals looks like:

When considering again the 1D monoatomic crystal but treat it as a periodic system with a super-period, $R=Na$ i.e., a **super-cell representation** of the crystal, the corresponding dispersion may look like this:

​	One can see that a larger real space cell, a smaller reciprocal space cell. In the super-cell representation, the dispersion relation consists of two branches that can be obtained graphically by **folding the dispersion curve** of $N=1$ cell about two vertical lines at wavenumbers $-\frac{\pi}{2a}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2a}$. The super-cell representation of the band structure is purely mathematical representation. In general, one can construct the band structure of  a super-cell with period $Na$ by folding the single dispersion curve of $N$ times inside a *reduced Brillouin zone*: $[0, \frac{\pi}{Na}]$.

### 1D Diatomic Harmonic Crystals

Schematic representation of the corresponding band structure in the *irreducible Brillouin zone* :

One can see that a gap appears at $k=\frac{\pi}{2a}$ between the low-frequency *acoustic branch* and a high-frequency *optical branch*. In the limit $m_1=m_2=m$ , the band structure reduced to that of the 1D monoatomic crystal in super-cell representation with $N=2$ . The construction of the band structure of the diatomic crystal may then be understood conceptually by first considering the folded band structure of the monoatomic crystal with a super-period $R = 2a$ . **The waves with wave number $k = \frac{\pi}{2a}$ have a wavelength $\lambda = \frac{2 \pi}{k}=4a$** . The wavelength is twice the period of the monoatomic crystal. Then, we label *alternating atoms* with odd and even numbers in the monoatomic crystal. If at some instant an even atom undergoes a zero displacement, then the displacement of all other even atoms will also be zero. At the same time, all odd number atoms will be subjected to a maximum displacement.

The even and odd atom sublattices support the $\lambda = 4a $ wave with the same frequency as long as their masses are the same. However, if the masses are not same, the frequency of the $\lambda = 4a $ wave will be lower for the heavier atoms than for the lighter ones. Approaching the diatomic crystal by perturbing the masses of the monoatomic crystals separates the folded branches of the monoatomic crystal at $k=\frac{\pi}{2a}$ leading to the formation of the gap.

## 描述带隙位置用归一化频率

即：$\frac{fa}{c}$ ($a$ 为晶格常数，$c$ 是介质声速，计算时都需要代入单位)

比如散射体系 $\Gamma$ 点的第二带隙归一化频率在 $1$ 附近, $K$ 点的归一化频率在 $0.5$ 左右。例如 [He C, Nat.Phys.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3867)中 $\Gamma$ 点：
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{20[\text{kHz}]\times\sqrt{3}[\text{cm}]}{340[\text{m/s}]} \approx 1.01
\end{align}
$$
